Certainly! Here's a simple README text you can include with your Python program:

```plaintext
# Number Classifier

## Overview
This Python program classifies a given integer into one of three categories: negative, zero, or positive. It takes an integer input from the user and prints out a corresponding statement based on the input.

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Enter an integer when prompted.
3. The program will output whether the entered number is negative, zero, or positive.

## Example
### Input:
```
Enter a number: 3
```

### Output:
```
The number is positive.
```

### Input:
```
Enter a number: -5
```

### Output:
```
The number is negative.
```

### Input:
```
Enter a number: 0
```

### Output:
```
The number is zero.
```

Feel free to use and modify the code as needed. Happy coding!
```

Make sure to save this text in a file named `README.txt` or something similar in the same directory as your Python program.
